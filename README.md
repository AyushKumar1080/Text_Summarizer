This project creates a web-based text summarization tool using Python and Flask. It lets users input long text and returns a condensed version using NLP techniques.

Core Workflow:

Configure config.yaml and params.yaml for model settings

Define entities and data classes

Build components like tokenizer and encoder

Chain modules using a pipeline

Launch the app using main.py and app.py

How to Run Locally:

Clone the repository

Set up a Conda environment with Python 3.8

Install dependencies from requirements.txt

Run app.py to launch locally

Open your browser at the localhost port to use the summarizer
